		<td><p align="justify"> My preferences include an appreciation for the color pink, an inclination for exploring new experiences, a strong affinity for spending quality time with friends and family, and a passion for indulging in the pleasure of listening to music. On the contrary, I harbor a distinct dislike for pickles. In my leisure time, I engage in the following hobbies: cooking, tending to gardens, and reading. 
My strongest trait is that I am headstrong. Being headstrong has a significant impact on my academic life, with both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, my determination and persistence drive me to excel in my studies, and I'm adept at setting and achieving academic goals. This determination also lends itself to leadership roles in student organizations and projects. Additionally, my independence is an asset in self-directed learning situations, like research projects.However, there are downsides to being headstrong. Stubbornness can sometimes make me resistant to alternative viewpoints or collaboration, potentially hindering my ability to adapt to new information or feedback. This assertiveness can lead to conflicts with peers or instructors if I'm unwilling to compromise. Moreover, overcommitting myself academically or pushing too hard can result in burnout, negatively impacting my overall well-being and academic performance. Thus, while being headstrong can be an asset, I must strike a balance to ensure a well-rounded and successful academic journey. </p></td>

		<td><p align="justify"> Someone I look up to is a fictional character from a book titled ‘All the bright places’ named Theodore Finch. Finch, a teenage boy struggling with mental illness, is a loner. He uses time tracking and manipulating others' perceptions of him to control his unruly psyche. Finch's love for Violet is sincere and he understands her grief, but he does so on his own terms, a function of his illness. Despite his tough exterior, Finch craves acceptance from his father and mother. His father's rejection and mother's disappointment cloud his love for her, as she doesn't truly understand him. Finch's illness leads to his need for control and manipulation, as he is unable to be true malice towards anyone except his father and Roamer. He also desires Violet's love and acceptance. Finch creates an itinerary for Violet to find after his death, controlling her emotions by leaving clues that he knows will inspire her to feel joy and release, but more importantly, to remember him forever. I look up to him because despite being on the edge of death, both literally and metaphorically, he continued to put others first. I chose him because after reading the book and watching the movie adaptation, I was greatly moved by his continued selflessness up until his suicide. I have aspired to be as kind and considerate as him ever since and his story motivates me to be mindful of what others might be going through despite whatever I’m facing. </p></td>

		<tr><td><p align="justify"> Practical and down-to-earth, Guardians believe in following the rules and cooperating with others. They are not very comfortable winging it or blazing new trails; working steadily within the system is the Guardian way, for in the long run loyalty, discipline, and teamwork get the job done right. I think the test may have some validity however I wouldn't say 100 percent due to the vagueness of the questions. Though I think my results were fairly accurate as I do see myself as a practical and down-to-earth person who likes to stick to a routine and get my work done in a timely and effective manner. </p></td></tr>
