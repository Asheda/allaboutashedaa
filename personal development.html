		<td><p align="justify"> The book emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility for our actions and outcomes. We should reflect on areas in our lives where we can take more ownership and accountability. This might involve setting clear goals and creating a plan to achieve them. It discusses the significance of setting specific, measurable, and achievable goals. We should consider how we can apply this concept by setting meaningful goals in our personal and professional lives. The book may explore the idea of building strong character and integrity. We should reflect on our values and how we can align our actions with those values to lead more principled lives. Personal growth is often a key theme in such books. We should think about how we can incorporate lifelong learning into our routines, whether through reading, courses, or seeking mentorship. Building and maintaining meaningful relationships are crucial for personal and professional success. We should consider how we can strengthen our existing relationships and cultivate new ones. Remember that the effectiveness of applying these principles to our lives depends on our commitment and consistency. It's often helpful to create a personal development plan and take small, actionable steps toward our goals. Additionally, regularly reflecting on our progress and making necessary adjustments is essential for long-term growth and success. </p></td>

		<td><p align="justify"> I am working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computing. So far I have acquired the skills; critical thinking, problem solving and teamwork. Critical thinking is a foundational skill in my field of computing. It involves my ability to analyze complex problems, evaluate information, and make reasoned decisions. In my academic pursuits, critical thinking allows me to approach challenging assignments, projects, and coursework with a logical and analytical mindset. It helps me break down complex problems into manageable components, identify patterns, and develop innovative solutions. Problem-solving is at the core of computing. My ability to identify, analyze, and resolve technical issues is crucial for success in my degree program and future career. Whether I'm debugging code, optimizing algorithms, or designing software applications, problem-solving skills help me tackle a wide range of challenges effectively. While computing often involves independent work, teamwork remains an essential skill. Collaborative projects and group assignments are common in both academic and professional settings. My experience with teamwork has likely taught me the importance of effective communication, coordination, and leveraging the strengths of team members. These skills will continue to serve me well as I take on more complex and specialized topics in computing. </td><p>
